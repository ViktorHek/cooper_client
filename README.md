# Cooper Test Challenge

## Getting Started 

To get started you need to not only clone this Repo but also the Cooper test API, witch can be found [here](https://github.com/ViktorHek/cooper_test.git).
When you have both the frontend and the backend you need to start them both. Without the backend you won't be able to store your information or create/authenticate your account and without the frontend you won't be able to see the webpage where you can navigate the site easily, like creating an account, type in your data and display it.

## Acknowledgement
