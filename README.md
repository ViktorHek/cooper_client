# Cooper Test Challenge

## Getting Started 

To get started you need not only the clone this Repo but the Cooper test API, witch can be found [here](https://github.com/ViktorHek/cooper_test.git)
when you have both the frontend and the backend you need to start them both. Without the backend you won't be able to store your information or create/authenticate your account. and without the frontend you won't be able to see the webpage where you can navigate the site easy, like creating an account, typ in your data and present it.
